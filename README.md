This is my personal curriculum vitae (CV) template. 
This is not my own built template, and all the credit should give to the original author [Debarghya Das](http://debarghyadas.com). 

### Requirement

This template uses several fonts not included with Windows/Linux by
default. If you get compilation errors saying a font is missing, find the line
on which the font is used and either change it to a font included with your
operating system or comment the line out to use the default font. 

Require to built with XeLaTeX.

### License
